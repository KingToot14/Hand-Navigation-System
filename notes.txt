 --- Class Breakdown ---

HandPair:
 - Holds the logic for storing a single "pair of hands" - left and right
 - This should allow multiple users to be distinctly identified even on the same camera
 - Given a frame, it attempts to detect hands in an image, passing on the relevant info to the Hand instances

Hand:
 - Holds the logic for a single hand
 - Inherited by "HandGesture" and "HandPointer"
 - Can take in landmark info to calculate new positions

HandGesture:
 - Holds the logic for the "gesture" hand in the primary navigation system.
 - Shortcuts, alt, shift, ctrl, etc.

HandPointer:
 - Holds the logic for the "pointer" hand in the primary navigation system.
 - Controls the mouse movement, clicks, etc.


 --- Flow ---
Receive Capture => split into sections => find landmarks => pass to hands

ImageManager receives the given capture (or VideoCapture(0) by default) => ImageManager splits the input into
the required sections => HandDetector attempts to locate hand landmarks and pass them onto their designated pair
